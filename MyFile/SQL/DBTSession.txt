DBT:REVISION

1.char vs varchar
Ex:
X Char(10)/Y Varchar(10)
if we stored data of 3 character then X column occupy 10 full but Y occupy 3 only.


UNIQUE:can have more than one NULL values.
PK can not change value if its value use as FK in other table

UNION-UNION ALL
1. no. column and data type should be same
2. column name may be different



OBJECT:table ,index,trigger,view
if base table delete then view not deleted(not active also) but index and trigger deleted
